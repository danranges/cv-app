## Other Notes

Using functional components and hooks took a little getting used to, but I think the flexibility and
the lower mental overhead in the long run is absolutely worth it. Custom and third-party hooks are
also a huge boon. Passing around dates in React is an even bigger headache than vanilla, but I think
it's finally starting to take root in my brainz. Might try a different css framework next time, or
possibly some sort of styled components, just to switch it up.
